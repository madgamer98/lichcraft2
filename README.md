### Description

This is a patch to the Lichcraft 2 mod that's goal is to fix any outstanding bugs left with the mod

<hr />

### INSTALLING THE PLUGIN

This mod requires both Tribunal and Bloodmoon to be installed.
It also requires the base Lichcraft 2 mod files.

To install the patch, unzip the .esp into the Morrowind/Data Files directory
overwriting vn_lichcraft2.esp and vn_lichcraft2_alt.esp.

**NOTE**: If you are also running the Mad Leveller, make sure it is loaded AFTER LichCraft. Additionally, DO NOT use
 the Mad Leveller LichCraft fix. It is no longer compatible, or necessary.

There are 3 .esp included with this plugin.

- vn_lichcraft2.esp - default. When you become a Lich, you lose the ability to use certain clothing slots  
- vn_lichcraft2_alt.esp - Alternative. When you become a Lich you may use any equipment slot, but your original appearance is forever lost.

- vn_lichcraft2_VH_Patch.esp - Compatability Patch for Vampire Hunger to handle Attribute Fortification refresh when possessing a host.
Can be used with the default or alt Lichcraft 2 esp. **Only activate if you have Vampire Hunger Activated**

### Original Credits
     
 VenomByte
- Created the Mod  

TheLys
- wrote the original Lich script, an invaluable starting point for this mod

Charles J. Devito (rhe1@gte.net) / LDones (ldones@hiredgoons.net)
- for the original Lich ideas taken from Illuminated Order. As well as many of their scripts that have been 
borrowed to some extent.

GhanBuriGhan
- for Morrowind Scripting for Dummies. I couldn't have coded a tenth of the script in this mod if I hadn't had
this as a reference. (Or perhaps I could, but it'd have taken ten times longer)

TheOneWriath
- for all the lore on Liches, without which this mod wouldn't be what it is. And likely wouldn't have even gotten off the ground.

Cj Campbell
- for originally hosting the mod on www.brimd.com/lichcraft

Cortex
- some of my key scripting concepts were inspired by the techniques used in VE.


tsbasilisk, reffa, and everyone wlso who is/was involved in testing or brainstorming on this mod.
