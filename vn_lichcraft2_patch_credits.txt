     2. Original Credits
*****************************************************************

TheLys
- wrote the original Lich script, an invaluable starting point for this mod

Charles J. Devito (rhe1@gte.net) / LDones (ldones@hiredgoons.net)
- for the original Lich ideas taken from Illuminated Order. As well as many of their scripts that have been 
borrowed to some extent.

GhanBuriGhan
- for Morrowind Scripting for Dummies. I couldn't have coded a tenth of the script in this mod if I hadn't had
this as a reference. (Or perhaps I could, but it'd have taken ten times longer)

TheOneWriath
- for all the lore on Liches, without which this mod wouldn't be what it is. And likely wouldn't have even gotten off the ground.

Cj Campbell
- for originally hosting the mod on www.brimd.com/lichcraft

Cortex
- some of my key scripting concepts were inspired by the techniques used in VE.


tsbasilisk, reffa, and everyone wlso who is/was involved in testing or brainstorming on this mod.
You know who you are!

     7. FAQ/Other notes
*****************************************************************

F.A.Q

1) Can a Vampire become a Lich?
Yes, you can. You follow the same process but with a different potion. As a Vampiric-Lich you cannot use normal
restore health or magicka effects, but there are new ways to gain them...

2) Can I be cured of Lichdom?
No. The process is completely irreversable.

3) Why can't I pick up the book on Necromancy?
That bug has been fixed. You can now.

4) Where can I find Adamantium Ore?
For this, and various other 'How do I' and 'Where is' questions, check the spoiler skull in the census and
excised office in seyda neen

5) Do I take on someone's appearance when I possess them?
No. You remain a skeleton, and your disguised form remains as before. Effectively, you take on only thier physical
attributes - strength, speed, agility, and endurance.

6) Can I enter the Phylactery in any way other than almost dying?
Remember, the phylactery is a 'net' to catch your soul. It's not a retreat you can hop off to when you feel like it.
Previously, the answer to this questions was 'no'. But now there is a way. There is a unique spell in the Avenue
of Necromancy which allows you to fake your own death. If you're lucky, you might recieve this from a power ritual.

7) So hang on... what exactly IS a phylactery then?
When someone becomes a lich, their body dies, and their soul is transferred to a magical container. This container
is the phylactery. It houses the soul of the lich. The Lich may then animate its corpse, and go about its business
as if it were alive (well, as much as a corpse can). Should the Lich be 'killed', it's soul does not pass on to the
 next world, but instead returns to the phylactery, where it can reanimate its body and return to the world. 
A Lich is destroyed if it's phylactery is ever broken, wherever the Lich's animated corpse might be at the time.

8) What's the difference between your lich and the type you can come via Illuminated Order?
Far too many to list.

10) Will there be an Oblivion LichCraft?
Yes. If i turn out to get addicted to Oblivion too.


Other Notes:

*SEMI SPOILER*
See the Lich Crown? There's rather more to it than meets the eye.
